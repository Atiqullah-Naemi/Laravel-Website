Laravel is the most popular and one of the fastest growing php framework around.
This is an application which is built on top of Laravel. Although it is not an advanced application, but it has lots of functionality and it is a pretty advanced blogging system.
I choosed the name LaraWeb for this project, but you can name it anything you want. You can easily download and install this project in your machine. To do so, download the project and put it in your computer, create a database and configure the .env file, run "php artisan migrate", then create an account and login with that and you are ready to go!

Here is the screenshot for front-page of the application
